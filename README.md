`history` is a lightweight, but powerful JavaScript library that lets you easily manage session history in browsers, testing environments, and (soon, via React Native) native devices. `history` abstracts away the differences in these different platforms and provides a minimal API that lets you manage the history stack, navigate, confirm navigation, and persist state between sessions. `history` is library-agnostic and may easily be included in any JavaScript project.
