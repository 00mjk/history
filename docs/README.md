Welcome to the history docs! The library is very small, so there are really just a few files here for you to browse.

If this is your first time here, we'd recommend you first [install](Installation.md) the library and then read:

- [Getting Started](GettingStarted.md)
- [Navigation](Navigation.md)
- [Blocking Navigation](Blocking.md)
